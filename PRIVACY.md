# Privacy Policy
We take your privacy very seriou- Ok you got me there is no WE. it's ME the silly motherfucker.

Basically this is a privacy policy because it looks cool and I do silly things (ooooo scary)

## What information are collected?
Visits:
Upon visiting my very well made site (lie) your userAgent will be encrypted (using a hash and a salt).
This UserAgent will be used to track the total amount of site visits, the encryption making it totally anonymous.

Maintenance:
For maintenance / developement of the site additional data may be collected, however those informations are literally just what you give to the internet.
AKA IP Address, timestamps, UserAgents, all of that silly stuff.
So no I won't have access to your 120 gooncoins wallet or your 25TB collection of "homeworks".

## Cookies
Cookies are used in this case to store the site settings, which includes:
- background music volume
- literally nothing else because I don't have more ideas

## Third Party Sites
Yes this is a bio site so you WILL be redirected to certain sites if you click certain buttons.
I don't track any of that bullshit so if you click an OnlyFans link thats on you and I can't care less because I don't even know that you clicked it.

## Third Party Content
This site loads external content such as:
- fonts from google (unfortunately)
- libraries from jsdelivr and cloudflare
- jquery, the library AND cnd
- literally nothing else because I don't give a fuck about your data, im not google brodie

## Changes to policy
This policy can change at any time if I feel like it.
But honestly I still don't give a fuck about your data so that's the least of your worries
